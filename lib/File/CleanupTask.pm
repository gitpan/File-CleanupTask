=head1 NAME

File::CleanupTask - Delete/Backup files on a task-based configuration

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::CleanupTask;

    my $cleanup = File::Cleanup->new({
        conf => "/path/to/tasks_file.tasks",
        taskname => "TASK_LABEL_IN_TASKFILE",
    });

    $cleanup->run();

Once run() is called, the cleanup operation 'TASK_LABEL_IN_TASKFILE' specified
in tasks_file.tasks is performed.


=head2 CONFIGURATION FORMAT

A .tasks file is a text file in which one or more cleanup tasks are specified.
Each task has a label and a list of options specified as shown in the following
example:

    [TASK_LABEL_IN_TASKFILE]
    path                = '/home/savio/results/'
    backup_path         = '/home/savio/old_results/'
    backup_gzip             = 1
    max_days                = 3
    recursive               = 1
    prune_empty_directories = 1
    keep_if_linked_in       = '/home/savio/results/'

    [ANOTHER_LABEL]
    path = 'C:\\this\\is\\a\\windows\\path'
	...


In this case, [TASK_LABEL_IN_TASKFILE] is the name of the cleanup task to be
executed.

The following options can be specified under a task label:

=head3 path

The path to the directory containing the files to be deleted or removed. Note
that in MS Windows the backslashes of a path names should be escaped and
apostrophese are strictly needed when specifying a path name (see example
above).

=head3 backup_path

If specified, will cause files to be moved in the specified directory instead
of being deleted. If backup_path doesn't exist, it will be created.  Symlinks
are not backed up. The files are backed up at the toplevel of backup_path in a
.gz (or .tgz, depending on backup_gzip) archive, which preserves pathnames of
the archived files.

=head3 backup_gzip

If set to "1", will gzip the files saved in backup_path. The resulting archive
will preserve the pathname of the original file, and will be relative to
'path'.

For example, given the following configuration:

   [LABEL]
   path = /path/to/cleanup/
   backup_path = /path/to/backup/
   backup_gzip = 1

If /path/to/cleanup/my/target/file.txt is encountered, and it's old, it will be
backed up in /path/to/backup/file.txt.gz. Uncompressing file.txt.gz using
/path/to/backup as current working directory will result in:

   /path/to/backup/path/to/cleanup/my/target/file.txt


=head3 max_days

The number of maximum days within which the files in the cleanup directories
are kept.  If a file is older than the specified number of days, it is queued
for deletion.

For example, max_days = 3 will delete files older than 3 days from the cleanup
directory.

max_days defaults to 0 if it isn't specified, meaning that all the files are to
be deleted.

=head3 recursive

If set to 0, only files within "path" can be deleted/backed up.
If set to 1, files located at any level within "path" can be deleted.

=head3 prune_empty_directories

If set to 1, empty directories will be deleted regardless their age.

=head3 keep_if_linked_in

A pathname to a directory that may contain symlinks. If specified, it will
prevent deletion of files and directories within path that are symlinked in
this directory, regardless their age.

This option will be ignored in MS Windows or in other operating systems that
don't support symlinks.

=head3 do_not_delete

A regular expression that defines a pattern to look for. Any pathname matching
this pattern will not be erased, regardless their age. The regular expression
applies to the full pathname of the file or directory.

=cut

=head3 delete_all_or_nothing_in

If set to 1, immediate subfolders in path will be deleted only if all the files
in it are deleted.

=head3 pattern

If specified, will apply any potential delete or backup action to the files
that match the pattern. Any other file will be left untouched.

=cut

=head3 enable_symlinks_integrity_in_path

If set to 1, the symlinks inside 'path' will be deleted only if their target
will be deleted. This option is disabled by default, which means that the
target of symlinks within the path will not be questioned during
deletion/backup, they will be just treated as regular files.

This option will be ignored in MS Windows or in other operating systems that
don't support symlinks.

=head1 METHODS



=head2 new

Create and configure a new File::CleanupTask object.

The object must be initialised as follows:
    
    my $cleanup = File::Cleanup->new({
        conf => "/path/to/tasks_file.tasks",
        taskname => 'TASK_LABEL_IN_TASKFILE',
    });

=cut
sub new {
    my $class  = shift;
    my $params = shift;
    my $self   = { params => $params };
    $self->{config_simple} = new Config::Simple;

    $self->{cmd_gzip} = File::Which::which('gzip'); 
    if (!$self->{cmd_gzip}) {
        $self->_warn(
            "No gzip executable found in your path."
             . " Option backup_gzip will be disabled!"
        );
    }
    return bless $self, $class;
}

=head2 command_line_run

Given the arguments specified in the command line, processes them,
creates a new File::CleanupTask object, an then calls C<run>.

Options include I<dryrun>, I<verbose>, I<task> and I<conf>.

=head3 dryrun
    just build and show the plan, nothing will be executed or deleted.

=head3 verbose
    produce more verbose output.

=head3 task
    optional, will result in the execution of the specified task.

=head3 conf
    the path to the .tasks configuration file.

=cut
sub command_line_run {
    my $class     = shift;
    my $rh_params = {};

    GetOptions(

=head2 _plan_add_actions

Given a path to a file and the task configuration options, augment the plan
with actions to take on that file.

Returns the array containing one or more actions performed.

These actions are meant to be performed in reverse sequence on the given file.
An empty array_ref is returned if no action is to be performed on the given
file.

A returned action can be one of: delete, backup. 

Resulting actions are decided according to one or more of the followings:

 - options in the configuration
 - the target files
 - the never_delete

This method works under the assumption that the specified file or directory
exists and the user has full permissions on it.

=head2 _refine_plan

Takes into account symlinks in the current plan.

The refinement is done in the following way:

1) Go through the plan, and look for symlink targets.

2) Mark any symlink with as the action of it's target if it's in the cleanup
   directory: keep the symlink if its target is kept, delete otherwise (broken
   symlinks, or pointing outside the cleanup, target is being backupped...).
   While deciding this, build an hashref of 
   { symlink_parent (canonical) => symlink_path (non_canonical) }.

3) Add the symlink to the plan in the correct position.
   To do this, build another 'refined' plan.
   - go hrough the pathnames (visits parents first) in the plan, pop each item.
   - if the parent of a marked symlink is found, do the following:
     * mark it as 'delete' if the symlink is going to be deleted.
       or mark it as 'nothing' if the symlink is not going to be deleted.
     * push the parent in the refined plan.
     * push the symlink in the refined plan.

4) Fix the plan to have consistent state (bubble up states between pairs of
   directories)

Return the refined plan.

Given a path to a symlink and a hash reference, keep the symlink target as a
key of the hash reference (canonical path), and the path to the symlink (non
canonical) as the corresponding value. Because multiple symlinks can point to
the same target, the value of this hashref is an arrayref of symlinks paths.

Returns true on success, or false if a path to something else than a symlink is
passed to this method.
